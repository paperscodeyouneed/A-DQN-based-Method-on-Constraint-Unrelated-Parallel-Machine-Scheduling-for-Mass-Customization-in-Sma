# A DQN-based Method on Constraint Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling for Mass Customization in Smart Manufacturing Factory

To ensure that readers can reproduce the experimental results described in this paper, we have organized the test code and network weights for the algorithm described in the paper, tested on four different datasets. Due to file size limitations exceeding the maximum upload size allowed by GitHub, we have stored the code on Google Drive. Any reader can access and attempt to reproduce the experiment via the link provided below. To fully reproduce our code, please ensure your computer meets the following requirements: Windows 11 as the operating system, Intel® Core™ i7-11800H (2.30GHz, 11th Gen) processor, 32GB RAM, NVIDIA RTX 3060 graphics card (VRAM = 6GB), Python version 3.8.20, cuDNN 8.9.2.26, Keras 2.4.3, ptan 0.4, and PyTorch 1.12.1. Once the environment is configured, please run the agent.py file in each project folder. The result will show the average queueing time and average idle time for each job under the optimal parameters. Since the tasks in our problem scenario have a constant due time (which can be found in the titles of Tables 2-5), the values for other optimization objectives can be verified against the methodology described in Table 1 for consistency with the results in the paper. If you encounter any issues during the reproduction process, please contact the corresponding author via the email provided in the paper.
